Ggridge script is from Chelsea Smith and really easy to follow with looking at specific taxa length class abundances to get cool plots. The 2P.2.0 script was where I added biomass equations with justification just to be certain that any hand-made biomass errors were 100% eliminated. It is also in this code that I do the major transformations of my raw data into the pretty format I needed to do further plotting/2P stuff. Also, all the 2P stuff is in here and annotated pretty well but still complicated. I also of course have some figures in there. This is still a pretty messy script.

I switched to the 2P3.0 for my final thesis figures, adding in food resources, etc. I cut out all the thousands of line of code that I needed to get 2P and instead just start from the top with TOTALPROD.csv, which I made in 2P.2.0 after calculating 2P for everything. Itâ€™s essentially the summary sheet for production and made the code much more efficient. All the figures from my thesis are in here and maybe more
